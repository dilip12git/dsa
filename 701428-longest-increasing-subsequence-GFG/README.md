# [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence-1587115620/1)
## Medium
Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, the task is to find the length of the Longest Strictly Increasing Subsequence (LIS).A subsequence is strictly increasing if each element in the subsequence is strictly less than the next element.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [5, 8, 3, 7, 9, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest strictly increasing subsequence could be [5, 7, 9], which has a length of 3.
Input: arr[] = [10, 6, 3, 11, 7, 15]
Output: 3
Explanation: One of the possible longest strictly increasing subsequences is [10, 11, 15], which has a length of 3.
Input: arr[] = [3, 10, 2, 1, 20]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest strictly increasing subsequence could be [3, 10, 20], which has a length of 3.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1030 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
